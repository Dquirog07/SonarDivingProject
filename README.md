Project Idea: Cave Diving Sonar Navigation System

Domain: The proposed application is a sonar navigation system designed specifically for cave divers. 

Event Descriptions:

Start Dive Event: Triggered when the diver initiates the dive sequence. This event activates the sonar mapping system to continuously scan and map the surrounding cave environment, sending real-time data to the diver's display.

Exit Detection Event: This event is triggered when the diver initiates the return sequence at the end of their dive. Utilizing a pre-established map and sonar-reflective markers (cookies) placed during the descent, the sonar system identifies and confirms the most feasible exit route. It is critical for safely guiding divers back to the entry point, providing clear directional cues on the diver’s watch and vibrational alerts to assist navigation in low visibility conditions.

Cookie Placement Event: During the dive, highly reflective sonar cookies are strategically placed along the dive line. These cookies are made from a material that enhances the sonar return signal, creating distinct signatures that are easily identifiable on the sonar map. This process not only marks the diver's path but also facilitates a reliable and traceable route back to the entry point by comparing the areas before and after cookie placement.

Consumers on the 'Read' Side:
The primary consumers of this application are experienced cave divers who utilize this system as a redundant safety mechanism. The device's outputs are consumed through an interface on the diver’s wristwatch, which displays sonar-generated maps and navigation prompts. Additionally, in case of severe visibility loss, the device employs vibrational signals as tactile alerts to guide the diver along the detected safe exit path, ensuring that even without visual cues, the navigation assistance remains uninterrupted.
